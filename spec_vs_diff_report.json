  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2. PreviewDialog.tsx has been updated with a fixed footer layout including dividers, consistent spacing, and a horizontal row of 4 footer images. renderDocumentToCanvas.ts includes footer layout constants, image loading logic, and a drawBajajFooter function rendering 4 images horizontally. Images are referenced from /assets/generated/ paths. However, the actual image files (footer-img-1 through footer-img-4) do not appear to have been added to frontend/public/assets/generated/ based on the diff summary showing no added files.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Footer images must be served as static assets from frontend/public/assets/generated/ — the 4 image files (footer-img-1.dim_200x80.png, footer-img-2.dim_200x80.png, footer-img-3.dim_200x80.png, footer-img-4.dim_200x80.png) must be present in that directory.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows 'Added: 0' files and lists no new files under frontend/public/assets/generated/. The code references these image paths but the actual PNG files do not appear to have been added to the repository.",
