  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (QR code removal) and REQ-2 (Share PDF on mobile). REQ-1 is largely satisfied: QR code removed from TemplateOverlay.tsx, renderDocumentToCanvas.ts (no QR calls visible), TemplateDesigner.tsx (QR tab/state removed per file summary), index.html (no QRCode.js script tag), and types/templates.ts (no QR fields). REQ-2 is implemented: sharePdf utility added, FormSection.tsx adds a Share PDF button with md:hidden (mobile-only), uses navigator.share with download fallback, and includes a loading/disabled state via sharingDoc state. One minor concern: qrPayload.ts and renderQr.ts appear as modified files with no content shown, making it impossible to fully confirm they are cleaned up.",
