  "summary": "All three requirements are substantially implemented in the diff. REQ-1 (Save button with 'Saved!' feedback) is present in TemplateDesigner.tsx. REQ-2 (Apply Header to All Templates with confirmation dialog) is implemented in TemplateDesigner.tsx and useTemplates.ts. REQ-3 (share after download using sharePdf) is implemented in both App.tsx (auto-share after download) and FormSection.tsx (explicit Share buttons). No significant missing requirements were found.",

    {
      "description": "FormSection includes standalone 'Share PDF' buttons that independently generate, download, and then attempt to share documents, operating separately from the main download flow in App.tsx.",
      "reason": "REQ-3 specifies surfacing a share option after a download completes, not adding independent share-trigger buttons that also re-generate and re-download the PDF. The spec says the share button should follow the download, not duplicate it. These extra buttons add their own PDF generation and download logic beyond what was requested.",
