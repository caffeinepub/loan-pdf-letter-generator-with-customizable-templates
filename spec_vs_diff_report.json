  "summary": "REQ-1 requires removing the Template Designer UI entry point (button, menu item, tab, or dialog trigger) without modifying TemplateDesigner.tsx or any template files. The diff shows the UI entry point (Advanced Template Designer button and Dialog modal) was removed from App.tsx, which satisfies the core requirement. However, the file-diff summary explicitly states that TemplateDesigner.tsx had 'all header/footer editing sections removed', which constitutes a modification of TemplateDesigner.tsx — a direct violation of the constraint and acceptance criteria.",

The file-diff summary for TemplateDesigner.tsx clearly describes content changes to the component.",
